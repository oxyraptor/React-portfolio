          I'm an engineering student pursuing a B.E. in Artificial Intelligence
          and Machine Learning from SPPU, Pune. I've been building my skills in
          Python, AI, and software development through personal projects,
          coursework, and internships. I use AI tools to assist with coding,
          debugging, and learning new technologies â€” it helps me work smarter
          and faster. My recent internships in IT and development gave me
          hands-on exposure to solving real-world problems in both technical and
          team settings.
